Testing area for ULX3S and store for bitstreams.

First upload: simplesoc.bit

## Simple 16 bit RISC SoC. 
Loosely based on the Acorn Atom. The SoC is a 16 bit RISC with 16 registers. Each register is 16 bit wide.
To demonstrate the SoC a simple BASIC version was written in C++ and also a 3D demo.

### Requirements:

 ULX3S - 85k.
 USB OTG cable and PS/2 supporting USB keyboard
 
 OTG cable connected to us2.
 
### Starting the demo:
type DEMO on the prompt and press enter.

### Creating a BASIC program:

type AUTO and enter.
The prompt will auto increment the BASIC line number and pressing Escape will end the editor.

### Running a BASIC program:
type RUN and enter.
